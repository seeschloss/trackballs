============= Problems compiling trackballs ===============


Q:  Configure fails when looking for GLU, but I have openGL
A:  Since you already have openGL you definitly *should* have GLU. Look for libGLU.so in
	eg: /usr/lib or /usr/X11R6/lib. If you have it you can first try doing:

      env LDFLAGS=-L/usr/X11R6/lib ./configure

    If configure still doesn't find GLU you can instead replace lines 3652 - 3713
    of ./configure with:

	  LIBS="-lGLU $LIBS"

	to make configure skip the GLU test. 


Q:  How do you make a distribution independent linux binary?
A:  Short answer, you don't. 
    Long answer: Try statically linking all the non-standard libraries (but not X11/GL), 
    do not use gcc 2.96 plus the most important thing; hold your thumbs!


Q:  While compiling i get the following error
		guile.cc.x:3: invalid conversion from `scm_unused_struct*(*)()' to `
		    scm_unused_struct*(*)(...)'
A:  This is caused by an error in guile-snarf on some boxes. You can get around it by
	manually editing all functions calls in guile.cc.x to be like:
			 scm_c_define_gsubr (s_new_mr_black, 2, 0, 0, (SCM (*)(...)) new_mr_black);


Q:  When compiling i the following error message: "undefined reference to 'gzread'"
A:  Try manually adding "-lz" to the LIBS variable in your Makefile (or Makefile.in) in the src directory.


============= Problems with binary releases ============


Q:  The binary doesn't work, it asks for libstdc++.so.5
A:  The easiest way of getting it is to upgrade to gcc3.2. Otherwise, if you are
    running debian you can point to Woody "testing" and do an "apt-get install libstdc++5"
    which also installs gcc3.2-base (which is not the gcc 3.2 compiler).


============= Graphic cards =============


Q:  The gamegraphics is very slow even though I have a whizbang 3D graphics card
A:  Do you have 3D acceleration working under X11? Make sure DRI is working properly
    and that the game is compiled against the X11 openGL drivers if you have compiled it
    yourself. To see if you have graphics acceleration working in your X-server use the 
    'glxinfo' program and look for the line "direct rendering: Yes".


Q:  The splashscreen, some background screens or the panel is only white.
A:  This can be caused by too little texture memory. You can either try to replace on of the
    image files (eg. ../share/trackballs/images/setupBackground.png) with a smaller one or
    let GL fallback to software rendering with:

		export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=x

    Some other environment variables of interest.


	LIBGL_DEBUG, if defined will cause libGL.so to print error and 
	diagnostic messages. This can help to solve problems. 
	Setting LIBGL_DEBUG to verbose may provide additional information.

	LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT, if defined this will force libGL.so to always 
	use indirect rendering instead of hardware acceleration. 
	This can be useful to isolate rendering errors.

	LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH can be used to override the default directories 
	which are searched for 3D drivers. The value is one or more 
	paths separated by colons. In a typical XFree86 installation, the 
	3D drivers should be in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/ and 
	LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH need not be defined. Note that this feature is
	disabled for set-uid programs. This variable replaces the 
	LIBGL_DRIVERS_DIR env var used in XFree86 4.0.
	MESA_DEBUG, if defined, will cause Mesa-based 3D drivers to 
	print user error messages to stderr. These are errors that 
	you'd otherwise detect by calling glGetError.

Q:  Bug when using ATI Radeon with DRI drivers: no textures are drawn anywhere
A:  Do "export R200_NO_TCL=1" before running the game. It should now work.


============= General problems using trackballs ==============


Q:  Trackballs is leaking huge amounts of memory
A:  This seem to be caused by faulty openGL drivers. Try disabling hardware accelleration.


Q:  I have too little memory to run trackballs without swapping.
A:  There are alot of things affecting the memory usage of trackballs. Try using the commandline option
    '--low-memory' which uses 15megs less memory but makes switching screens slightly slower.


Q:  Game crashes after message "Attempting to open mixer"
A:  Try shutting down artsd (if you are running KDE) or esd (if you
	are running GNOME). Alternativly you can start the game through
	artsdsp or esddsp instead. If neither of this works, use the -m flag
	to turn of sound.


Q:  Sound is out of sync.
A:	Shutdown any sound servers you are running (eg. artsd or esd) when playing.
	Eg. run "skill artsd ; trackballs ; artswrapper"


Q:  There's no background music when I'm playing
A:  Download the music from the homepage (or any other mp3's or ogg's) and place them in the
	$prefix/share/trackballs/music directory.


Q:  I cannot change flags/colors in the editor as documented.
A:  This might be caused by using keyboard layout which needs shift to get the numbers 
   (eg. frensh). Try temporarily changing keyboard layout to Swedish or US.


Q:  The fonts doesn't work for me
A:  There seem to be a problem with the libs for rendering the fonts in some systems. Try
    replacing share/trackballs/fonts/menuFont.ttf with some other TTF font on your system.


Q:  I can't get trackballs to recognise my joystick
A:  Have you setup joystick support properly for your distribution. You can test if you have it
    working properly by using the command "jstest /dev/js0". Does it work? If not, some hints below:

    Assuming you are using a analog gameport joystick (most people are!). Make sure you have loaded all the proper
    joystick modules.
	
	modprobe ns558       # For the gameport
	modprobe joydev      # For general joystick support
	modprobe analog	     # The specific driver for this joystick

	Now, does it work with jstest? If not, make sure you have /dev/js* devices setup properly.
    
	chmod 0644 /dev/js?
	
	Still doesn't work? Ok, we need to delete the actual device nodes and recreate them.

	cd /dev
	rm js?
	mkdir input
	mknod input/js0 c 13 0
	mknod input/js1 c 13 1
	mknod input/js2 c 13 2
	mknod input/js3 c 13 3
	ln -s input/js0 js0
	ln -s input/js1 js1
	ln -s input/js2 js2
	ln -s input/js3 js3

	Does it work now? If not you'll have to be satisfied with using the mouse or keyboard... sorry =(

Q:  Sometimes when I'm playing with a joystick the ball just start rolling of in one direction
A:  You might have a broken joystick which gives incorrect wrapover's on your axises. Try using the '--repair-joystick' 
    option. Possibly in conjunction with '--debug-joystick'


============= Trackballs and Solaris ==============

Q:  The game takes very long to start.
A:  This is caused by a bug in the highscores files which are not platform independent. Try deleting
    the highscores file and trackballs will start on a new one automatically.
