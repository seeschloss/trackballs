	  volume regards to the distance to the ball.
	- Added sideSpike. Same than 'spike', but coming from the side.

14 Mar 2003; Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>:
	* share/Makefile.am, share/trackballs.6:
		- Move man page to section 6, since trackballs is a game
	* configure.ac:
		- Check for libGLU seperately, since certain distributions package
		  libGL and libGLU seperately.

17 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Added snapshots during game (only). Press "Print" key to generate
	  a snapshot_xxx.ppm in the current directory. TODO: create an other
	  format than PPM (big!), put snapshots elsewhere ? Allow snapshots
	  everywhere (not only during game, i.e. to make nice documentation
	  with pictures...)

17 Mars 2003;  Mathias Broxvall <matbr@home.se>, bird.cc birh.h wings.png
	- New textured graphics for birds
	- Moved bird drawing to stage 2 so that their transparent parts will not 
	  other objects.

18 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Changed 'bindTexture' in 'glHelp.cc'. If the texture is not
	    found in the pre-loaded list, the texture is loaded and inserted
	    in the list. Also added a test if too much textures are loaded
	    (as it is a static array).
	- Added a name to the window of trackball (in mmad.cc). TODO: correct
	    the 'configure' in order to generate variables PACKAGE and VERSION
	    in the config.h, which can be use to refer to ourself.

18 Mars 2003;  Mathias Broxvall <matbr@home.se>:
	- Made player sensititive to being under water (runs out of oxygen)
	- Added new ball modification "float" together with modpills for it

	  the menuMode

18 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Changed name of the SDL window in order to use PACKAGE and VERSION
	- Added a '#include "../config.h" in 'general.h' (only if the
	  tag 'HAVE_CONFIG_H' is set) in order to exploit configuration
	  given by the 'configure' inside the code (no use for the moment,
	  but it may be usefull if we plan to make a robust game. In
	  particular I coded a soft and for Solaris _many_ things are
	  a little different... Using the config.h allow to switch parts
	  of the code to handle particular cases...)

20 Mars 2003;  Mathias Broxvall <matbr@home.se>:
	- Added texture coordinates to cells, drawing of textures.
	- Rewrote manipulation of textures in editor. 
	- Automatic translation of texture indices in map
	- Corrected all references of textures to be relative to loaded textures
	- New "rotational friction" to limit rotation speed when on ice, water etc. Might
	  reduce the top speed slightly on other surfaces. Check that all maps still work.
	- Added new splashes caused by rotation in water. Eg. "swimming"
	- Note. now only saving texture coords if texture is set or flags nonzero.
	- New commandline option "--touch" which can be used to update maps
	- Added a "stargate" like appearance to teleporters	

21 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Changed secondary color for teleport. Nicer effect.
	- Added map-is-transparent in my test level 'hxtst'.
	- Added a vertical push for the fountain. If player comes
	  just above the fountain, he is propulsed like a jump.
	  Vertical force is proportionnal to fountain's strength.
	- Corrected '--touch' option: the map name to touch was not
	  converted in BASEDIR/name format, so touching a map without
	  being in the map dir (or given the full path) was not possible
	- Corrected sound volume for spikes. Max is now 2/3 of the real
	  max volume.
	- Updated the README.html to include my objects.

21 Mars 2003;  Mathias Broxvall <matbr@home.se>:
	- Correct rotation for birds. Also added flag *bird-constant-height*
	- Corrected '--touch' so that it *also* works with absolute filename
	- Fixed bug with texture coordinates of compressed maps (not all coords are saved
	  to make compression more efficient)

21 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Added a help1_*.png in share/image, preparation more more
	  help screens.
	- Added support for help0, help1 and text in helpMode.{cc|h}
	- Added pictures of cactus, teleport and bird in help1.
	  Mathias: please edit help1_*.png because I don't have your
	  font to draw corresp. text.
	- Corrected collisions for sideSpike. Seems to work fine.
	  To be more tested.

22 Mars 2003;  Mathias Broxvall <matbr@home.se>:
	- Fixed bug with floating in shallow water
	- Changed push of fountain to take velocity (direction) of fountain into effect.	
	
25 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Added a new feature in edit mode: using TAB key with a selection
	  in 'Edit heights' mode "smooth" all the cells in the selection.
	  Each corner of each cell is modified in order to create a smooth
	  continuity. Usefull when building large smooth areas.
	- Pressing TAB without selection adjust the center height to the
	  average value of corners.
	- Corrected a bug in editMode.cc: 'hill' variable was not initialized
	  generating 'core dump' in some situations.
	- Added CTRL+TAB key. Flatten the current cell (height is the average
	  value of the 4 corners). Useful for putting objects in complex
	  levels on a flat cell.
	- Added level 'snowbord'. Not finished, but playable.
	- Updated a little bit the 'help1' screen.
	- Added some new features in levels (lv1, lv2 and lv5) (resp.
	  sidespikes, cactus and birds).
	- Removed an old 'debug' display in sidespike.

26 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Added heightModifier.{cc|h}. Allow to modify the height
	  of a corner of a cell, and the corresponding heights of the
	  cells's corner which touch this corner (not very clear...).
	  Allow to make "waving" ground. See 'hxtst' for an example.

27 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Improved heightModifier behavior. More flexible.
	- Added a "wave" at end of level 'lv4' to reach goal (heightModifier
	  feature)
	- Improved 'Pause' mode behavior and look.
	- The mouse pointer in 'menuMode' now "blinks" a little.
	- Corrected a bug in *constant-height* for birds.

28 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Added sparkle2d.{cc|h}. Generates sparkles in 2D mode.
	- Added sparkles on the mouse pointer. Not sure it is very nice...

30 Mars 2003;  Mathias Broxvall <matbr@home.se>:
	- Finished the "waterworld" level.
	- Use constant value for water alpha (looks strange otherwise)

31 Mars 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Corrected a little bit the 'snowbord' level. It is now a little
	  bit simpler (but a little only). PS: I finish this level loosing
	  at most one life.
	- Added the missing file 'share/image/glitter.png'.

	  by font system).
	- Added src/font.{cc|h}. Crash.

02 April 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Code no more generates crash. Font system still not available.
	- First test of the font system. Just run the game and have
	  a look at the first menu. Nothing else available for the moment.
	- Font system is now functionnal, but minimalist. Have a look
	  to the starting menu for some tests with the different modes
	  available for drawing text. I'm working on text selection with
	  the mouse, but still don't know how I will highlight selected
	  text.

03 April 2003; Sam Listopad <samlii@users.sourceforge.net>:
	* src/Makefile.am, configure.ac:
		- Added checks for windows, and stuff to make Icons for windows
		  platform.

	  the two available fonts.
	- Added a third font for test purpose. Still some changes to
	  be done for genericity purpose, and some functions to add.
	- Added 'right' aligned texts
	- Added 'set_color' functions to allow to modify base color
	  and transparency for drawn texts (for each font).
	- Selection of text with mouse is ok. Working on a way to
	  highlight selected texts.
	- Text modification mechanism ok.

05 April 2003;  Mathias Broxvall <matbr@home.se>:
	- Changed some glPushX,glPushY followed by glPopX,glPopY to glPopY,glPopX 
	(where X,Y is Matrix or Attrib)
	- Added a commandline option "--low-memory" which reduced memory usaged with ~15 megs

15 April 2003; Yannick Perret <yperret@bat710.univ-lyon1.fr>:
	- Added 'delAllText()' in menuMode when leaving first menu screen
	  (to prevent texts to stay displayed).
	- First tests for 3D text drawing (ugly!)

21 April 2003; Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>:
