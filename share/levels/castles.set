Blue Castle
Do YOU dare to enter and brave these four castles? Only the most
experienced and skilled Trackballs players will make it as far
as to the thoughest Ice and Glass castle - a place where you may
need to think twice to find you way through the maze. Use the digits
of PI as a clue in the last maze.
