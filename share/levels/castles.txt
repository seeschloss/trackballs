This level set was designed for experienced trackballs players.
Created by Attila Boros in 2006.

The Ice and Glass level (castle4) is tricky.
You can't go through the maze without thinking.
The digits of PI may help you to find the route out.

If you couldn't go through the maze,
you can find some help in the castle4.scm file.
