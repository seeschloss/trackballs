.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classic Atari 1980's arcade game 'Marble Madness' (later released by Electronic Arts for the Amiga and other platforms). 

By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues to the next, more difficult track \- unless the time runs out. 

It should be noted that this game is _not_ intended to be a replica of Marble Madness but rather merely inspired by it. For instance the game uses 3D graphics even though the original game had no real use for it. Also we aim at making the game highly configurable by a scripting extension (Guile) and provide a simple editor by which new levels easily can be created.
