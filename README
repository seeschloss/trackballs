1.		Introduction.

Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness
on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth
filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player
collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues
at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out. 

It should be noted that this game is not intended to be a replica of 
marble madness but rather inspired by it. For instance the game uses 
advanced 3D graphics even though the original game had no real use for 
it. Also we aim at making the game highly configurable by a scripting 
extension (Guile) and provide a simple editor by which new levels easily 
can be created. The current status of the project is very early in 
development and is thus barely playable.

You start /Trackballs/ by giving the command 'trackballs' which
instructs the game to load the first level. If you wish to cheat or simply
are testing out a level you are currently designing you can give the command
'trackballs -l foo' which jumps to level "foo". For more descriptions on how
to play trackballs and documentation of the level editor see the homepage at:

http://trackballs.sourceforge.net

There now also exists a forum where you can ask practical questions 
about getting started, share tips and tricks, upload your own creations or
just hang around. You'll find it at:

Have fun playing /Trackballs/ and if you make any levels please contact me 
so I can include them in future releases.

2. 		ABOUT SECURITY

Per default trackballs is not installed setuid or setgid and as such no serious security issues 
should arise as long as trackballs is played only with the default levels. However, extra
levels can be designed by users and upload/download from the internet.  Since the scripting 
capabilities within maps are very powerfull it also means a security vulnerability if you are 
running custom maps created by others. 

*** Never run a track downloaded from internet unless you trust the creator or if you have carefully 
read the corresponding .scm file of the track. ***

This also means that trackballs must never be run with the setuid flag set and preferably 
not with any setgui flags either unless you trust all your users compoletly (which still is a 
bad security practise!)

However, running trackballs without the setuid/setgid flags means that it might not be possible for 
users to modify the highscores file (default installed at /usr/local/share/trackballs/highScores) unless
you have setup the privileges of all users to allow this. Rather than setting trackballs setgid games
it is therefore better to use local highscore files on a per user basis. To do so configure and compile 
trackballs with the --with-highscores=~  argument and all highscores will be saved under the current
users $HOME/.trackballs/highscores file instead.
