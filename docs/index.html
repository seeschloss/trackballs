<h1> 1.0 - What is Trackballs? </h1>

 Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble
 Madness on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a
 labyrinth filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other
 obstacles, the player collects points. When the ball reaches the
 destination it continues to the next, more difficult track - unless
 the time runs out.  
<p/>

 It should be noted that this game is not intended to be a replica of
 marble madness but rather inspired by it. For instance the game uses
 advanced 3D graphics even though the original game had no real use
 for it. Also we aim at making the game highly configurable by a
 scripting extension (Guile) and provide a simple editor by which new
 levels easily can be created. 
<p/>

<h1> 2.0 - Starting Trackballs </h1>

After starting the game you will find yourself presented with menu of
different options. If you want to change some settings such as
graphics quality, language support or input devices go to the
"Settings" screen. 
<p/>

To start playing a game go to the "New game" menu
option. On this screen you can enter your name by hovering with the
mouse over the "Player name" field and typing on the keyboard. Giving
your real name here is a good idea since it lets the game remember
some statistics such as which levels you have completed, your best
scores etc. After entering your name you should decide which "level
set" you want to play. These level sets are like different version of
the game with a different feel to them, often made by different people
all over the internet. You can browse between the diffferent sets of
levels by left and/or right clicking on the name of the level set.
<p/>

Once you have decided which level set to play you can start the game
by pressing the "Start game" button or you can first select difficulty
by left/right clicking on the difficulty button. 
<p/>

<b> Tip: </b> You can even customize the appearance of your ball here
by left and right clicking on it. Try clicking until you have a good
looking ball. 

<h3> 2.1 - Playing the game </h3>

Once you are in the game you will see the first level. To actually
start playing press the spacebar key. You can now move around you ball
using either the mouse, the keyboard arrows (or nummerical keyboard)
or by using a joystick if you had configured that in the settings
screen. 
<p/>

The goal of the game is to get points while moving through the
different levels and finding the exits. Usually you have a time limit
and will die when the time is up, so you'd better be quick about
finding the next exit. On your way you will encounter a number of
obstacles of various kinds, some equipment to help you and different
terrain which is more of less difficult to get pass. 
<p/>

Good luck!
